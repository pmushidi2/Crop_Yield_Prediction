# Crop Yield Prediction and Climate Impact Assessment

This project focuses on developing machine learning models for predicting crop yields and assessing climate change impact on agriculture. It follows a multi-step process, including data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation.

## Key Features

- Data collection from various sources.
- Preprocessing to handle missing values and encode categorical variables.
- Feature engineering to improve prediction accuracy.
- Model selection, including Random Forest, Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks, and a Stacked Model.
- Evaluation metrics to assess model performance.
- Analysis of agricultural production trends and climate impact insights.
